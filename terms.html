						<h2>6. Restrictions to Use</h2>

						<h2>9. Assumption of Risk</h2>
						<p>You understand and agree that the Licensed NFTs are made solely for entertainment purposes only. You agree and
							understand that that: (1) the market and prices for a blockchain asset are extremely volatile and subjective and
							collectible blockchain assets, such as the Licensed NFTs, have no inherent or intrinsic value, and fluctuations in the
							price of such blockchain assets could materially and adversely affect the price and value of your Licensed NFTs; (2)
							there are risks involved with using internet-based currency and asset, including, but not limited to, risk of
							hardware, software, internet connection failure, risk of malicious software, and risk that unauthorized parties may
							gain access to your personal information including such information and assets contained in your digital wallet or
							elsewhere; (3) internet-based currency and assets are not currently regulated by any regulatory regimes, and new
							regulations or policies that may materially affect the value of any Licensed NFTs; (4) there is an inherent risk that
							you may lose access due to loss of private keys, custodial error, or even purchaser error; (5) there are risks related
							to taxation; and (6) L2E does not make any guarantees or representations about the availability of the Licensed NFTs
							or the art or that they will host the Licensed NFTs or the Art in any specific location for any specific period of
							time.</p>

							purchase or otherwise obtain the Licensed NFTs and that you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for
							determining the value, nature, and appropriateness of the above risks for yourself.</p>
						<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
						<p>ALL LICENSED NFTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
							L2E AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
							WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL L2E BE
							LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXTRAORDINARY, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
							(INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, TECHNOLOGY
							FAILURE, OR MALFUNCTION, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE RELATED TO ANY LICENSED NFT OR OTHERWISE)
							HOWEVER ARISING, EVEN IF L2E KNOWS THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
						<h2>11. Release</h2>
						<p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING
							APPLIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF
							CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
							NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER
							MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE
							CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME
							INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE. YOU RELEASE US FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATING TO OUR SITE OR L2E
							CONTENT, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES,
							KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST US. THIS RELEASE DOES NOT
							APPLY TO NEW JERSEY USERS.</p>
						<p>If you are a resident of a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding release, then the following
							applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this Agreement, waive the applicability of
							California Civil Code Section 1542 which states, “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
							not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her
							must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” You hereby waive this section of the California
							Civil Code. You hereby waive any similar provision in law, regulation, or code that has the same intent or effect as
							the aforementioned release. You release us from any liability relating to our site or L2E Content, and you release us,
							our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out
							of or in any way connected with any claim you have against us. This release does not apply to New Jersey users.</p>
						<h2>12. Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1988</h2>
						<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that
							material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith
							that materials hosted by L2E infringe your copyright, you, or your agent may send to L2E a notice requesting that the
							material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on
							its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not
							be deemed to confer upon L2E actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are
							evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the
							DMCA permits you to send to L2E a counter-notice. All notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory
							requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. L2E’s Copyright Agent for notice of
							claims of copyright infringement or counter notices can be reached as follows: through a direct message to sin7
							Twitter at @7777Sins.</p>

							representative basis; arbitration can decide only your and/or L2E’ individual claims; and the arbitrator may not
							consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated (this does not apply to New
							Jersey users); (5) both parties will bear their own costs of representation and filing for the dispute; (6) where

						<h2>18. Class Action Waiver</h2>
						<p>You and L2E agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute whether through a court of law or
							arbitration shall be solely conducted on an individual basis. You agree that you will not seek to have any
							dispute heard as a class action, representative action, collective action, or private attorney general action.</p>
						<h2>19. Severability</h2>
						<p>In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.</p>
						<p>If two or more provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement you may have with L2E are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, you agree that L2E shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.</p>
						<h2>20. Waiver</h2>
						<p>We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.</p>
